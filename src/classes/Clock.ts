/*
Frontend:
    User => Tuning
        Main pitches = 1200/EDO cents or other custom tuning divisions (ex Just Intonation)
    User => KeySig
    keySig => group of notes
        ex: 
            Tuning = 7EDO, Key = 5th note in 7EDO 
            cent= {0, 240, 480, 720, 960}
            Initial restriction = 7 notes in 7EDO
            Further user can change each note by cents

Backend:
    Note => {...} (enum)
